okay so like everyone’s always complaining about school and don’t get me wrong, sometimes it literally sucks so bad 😭 but tbh there are actually some things that make it not completely terrible lol. so here’s my random list even tho my friends think i’m weird for this 🤪

seeing my friends literally every day ✨ 

this is probably why i don’t totally hate school tbh. like imagine not seeing your besties for months?? that would actually be torture 😵 there’s something nice about knowing that even if my morning is trash, i’ll see my friends and we can just hang out and be dumb together.
even when i’m dying in boring classes, just looking at my friends and trying not to laugh makes everything better lmaooo 💀 and the random hugs in the hallways hit different ngl 🥺

i literally met all my friends through school 👥

okay but fr without school i would know like nobody except family members lol 😂 ALL of my best friends are people i met at school. like people i sit next to in class or get paired up with for projects and now we’re besties.
it’s so random how you can just start talking to someone and then boom - new friend unlocked 🔓 and then you meet their friends and suddenly you have this whole friend group. school is basically how you find your people i guess

having a crush makes everything more interesting 👀💕

ngl having a crush at school just makes everything more exciting?? like suddenly you actually WANT to go to certain classes lol 😍 and you start caring about dumb stuff like how your hair looks.
all the little moments are so fun too - like when they say hi or when your friends catch you staring and start being annoying about it. honestly even if nothing happens it just makes school feel less boring and more like a movie or something 💭

knowing everyone and all the drama 📚☕

this might sound dumb but i love how at school you just know everyone?? like you’re not friends with everyone but you still know who they are and what’s going on with them. it’s like this little world where everyone’s connected somehow.
even people you don’t really talk to - you still know stuff about them lol. it makes everything feel less random i guess??

school = best place for gossip 🗣️✨

okay but WHERE ELSE are you gonna get this much tea every single day?? 🍵 school hallways are literally gossip central and i’m here for it ngl. between classes, at lunch, everywhere - someone’s always got something to say.
it’s not even just drama, it’s like who’s dating who, who failed tests, who got in trouble, weekend party plans… school is basically like having a news channel but make it teenage stuff 📺

poli sci is actually good (don’t judge) 🏛️

okay i KNOW everyone thinks i’m insane but… i actually like political science class?? like yeah it sounds boring but it’s actually cool when you start understanding how stuff works!
like we talk about elections and government and i’m not just sitting there confused anymore. i actually GET why adults stress about politics so much lol 🤯 it feels important too?? like we’re talking about real world stuff instead of just memorizing random facts.
it makes me feel smart and like my opinions matter. even if everyone else thinks it’s the most boring thing ever, i genuinely like those discussions about society and stuff 🧠


anyway that’s my weird list of why school doesn’t completely suck. obviously there’s still tons of stuff i hate (early morning classes can literally die 😤) but sometimes it’s nice to think about the good parts too!
but what do you like about school? lmk!! 💕
