okay so like my parents are lowkey confusing because sometimes they’re super strict and sometimes they’re chill?? like sometimes i can stay out super late but then other times i can’t even go to the mall lmaooo 😭 but the ONE thing that’s always a no is social media and honestly it’s killing me
my current mission: convince my dad to let me get instagram. literally ALL my friends have it and i just wanna fit in yk?? 😭😭 he told me as a challenge that i have to finish programming this website first so that’s what i’m doing rn.
and dad if you’re reading this - here are the reasons why you should totally let me download insta!! 💕

1. literally everyone my age has it 👥

okay but fr dad, i’m probably the ONLY person in my entire grade who doesn’t have instagram. like when my friends are talking about posts and stories and stuff, i’m just sitting there like 🧍‍♀️ because i have no clue what they’re talking about.
it’s honestly so awkward when they’re like “omg did you see what she posted” and i have to be like “no… i don’t have insta” and then they all look at me like i’m from the stone age or something 💀 i just wanna be part of the conversation without feeling like a total outcast!!

2. it’s actually educational (no really!!) 📚

i KNOW you think it’s just people posting random selfies but there’s actually so much cool educational content on there!! like there are accounts about science, art, books, current events - literally everything.
my friend showed me this account that explains history in a really fun way, and there are artists who post tutorials and writers who share book recommendations. it’s basically like having access to mini lessons about stuff i’m actually interested in. way more fun than regular studying lol 🤓

3. i can stay connected with friends 💬

like when people move away or switch schools, instagram is how we stay in touch!! and group chats on insta are where people plan hangouts and share updates about what’s going on.
right now when my friends make plans, they do it in instagram group chats and then someone has to remember to text me separately. it’s so much easier if i could just be in the group chat with everyone else instead of always being the last one to know about stuff 😅

4. it’s actually safer than you think 🔒

dad i promise i know about internet safety and privacy settings!! like i can make my account private so only people i actually know can see my stuff. and i won’t accept random followers or talk to strangers, obviously.
instagram has way better safety features now than it used to, and honestly it’s probably safer than some other apps i already have. plus you can literally see everything i post if you want - it’s not like i’m gonna hide anything sketchy lol. i just wanna post cute pics with my friends and see what everyone’s up to!

5. it’ll help with my photography and creativity 📸

you’re always saying i should have more hobbies and be creative, right?? well instagram would actually help with that! like i’d start paying more attention to photography and making my posts look good.
there are so many creative challenges and trends that actually look really fun, and seeing other people’s art and photography would inspire me to try new things. plus i could follow accounts related to my interests and discover new hobbies or skills. it’s basically like a creative community where i can learn from other people my age!

sooo… pretty convincing arguments right?? 😏 i mean i literally finished programming this whole website just to make this post so that shows i’m responsible and dedicated lol
i promise i’ll be super careful and responsible with it, and you can check my account whenever you want. i just really wanna be part of what everyone else is doing and not feel left out all the time 🥺

love you!! please consider it?? 💕✨
