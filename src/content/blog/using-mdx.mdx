okay so like everyone’s always asking me why i’m always writing in my journal and sticking random stuff in it lol. honestly it started for kinda sad reasons but now i’m literally obsessed and can’t stop?? so here’s why journaling is actually the best thing ever 💕

it started after my first breakup 💔

so basically i started journaling after my first boyfriend and i broke up and i needed something to keep me busy lol 😅 like i had all this free time and energy and didn’t know what to do with it??
so i was like okay i need a new hobby or something and for some reason i decided to try journaling!! idk where the idea came from but i just grabbed this random notebook and started doing stuff with it. at first it was literally just something fun to do instead of being bored all the time lmaooo 💀

started as scrapbooking vibes 📸✂️

in the beginning i wasn’t even really “journaling” tbh, it was more like scrapbook energy?? i would just stick random photos in there and magazine cutouts and concert tickets and whatever. like anything that looked pretty or reminded me of good times.
i wasn’t writing much, mostly just gluing stuff down and making it look cute. but it was actually so satisfying?? like creating something pretty with my hands instead of just scrolling on my phone for hours. plus it gave me something to do when i was bored or sad

now i write about literally everything 📝

but now i’m like fully into it and i write about EVERYTHING that happens lol. like school drama, family stuff, random thoughts, weekend plans, literally whatever. and i still add photos and stickers and make it look aesthetic because that’s half the fun!!
i’ll write about books i’m reading, movies i watched, places i went, people i hung out with… it’s like keeping track of my whole life in one place. sometimes i’ll look back at old entries and be like “oh yeah that happened” because i totally forgot 

it’s the perfect creative outlet 🌙

honestly when i’m bored or have a lot of energy, journaling is like the perfect way to channel that into something fun. like when i’m making pages and adding photos and decorating, i get totally focused and it’s actually really relaxing??
plus it takes time to do it right (if you’re a perfectionist like me lol) so it’s a great way to spend an afternoon or evening. like i can spend hours just 
on one page making it look perfect and it’s actually really satisfying 💭

keeping memories is actually so important 📚✨

okay this sounds cheesy but i love how i’m basically creating this record of my life?? like in 10 years i can look back and see exactly what i was thinking and doing when i was 15. all the little moments that seem random now but will probably be so nostalgic later.
like i write about the dumbest stuff - what i ate for lunch, funny things my friends said, what outfit i wore to school. but that’s the stuff you actually forget!! so it’s nice knowing i’ll have all these random memories saved somewhere 🥺

it makes me feel fancy and aesthetic af 💅

not gonna lie, part of why i love journaling is because it makes me feel so aesthetic and put-together lol. like when people see me writing in my journal with all my colorful pens and stickers, i feel like that girl who has her life together (even tho i definitely don’t 😭)
there’s something about having this beautiful journal with perfect handwriting and cute decorations that just makes me feel fancy?? like i’m living in a pinterest board or something. it’s giving main character energy and i’m here for it ✨

designing pages is literally so fun 🎨

but honestly the BEST part is making each page look perfect. like choosing which photos to print out, what stickers to use, how to arrange everything, what colors to write in… it’s like being an artist but for your own life??
and then when you’re done you can flip through and admire all your hard work!! it’s so satisfying looking at these beautiful pages that YOU created. like sometimes i’ll just sit there flipping through my journal because it looks so pretty and makes me happy 💕

(plus when friends come over they’re always like “omg your journal is so cute” and i get to show off all my favorite pages lmaooo)

anyway that’s why i’m literally obsessed with journaling now even tho it started randomly after a breakup 😂 like it went from just needing a hobby to being this whole aesthetic creative thing that i actually look forward to every day.

aaandd if you’re thinking about starting just DO IT!! you don’t need fancy supplies or perfect handwriting, just grab whatever notebook and start sticking stuff in it. trust me it’s so fun once you get started ✨
