		hey hey! 
		
welcome to my chaotic little corner of the internet lol
so basically i’m your typical 15-year-old german girl who’s about to turn 16  and honestly i have no idea what i’m doing with my life but here we are 💀


i’m literally obsessed with romance books like it’s actually concerning… my bookshelf is 90% enemies-to-lovers and i regret NOTHING. if you catch me crying over fictional men at 2am, no you didn’t ✋


when i’m not busy being delulu about book boyfriends, you can find me:
	
•	playing flute (yes i’m that girl in orchestra, we exist)

•	dancing around my room like nobody’s watching (spoiler: my neighbors probably are and i’m sorry)

•	hanging out with my friends 24/7 because we’re basically attached at the hip


OH and plot twist - in a few months i’m yeeting myself to canada for a whole year abroad!! kinda terrified but also SO excited?? like imagine all the maple syrup and apologizing i’ll get to do 😭


this blog is gonna be my way of documenting all the chaos, the feels, the random 3am thoughts, and probably way too many photos of my coffee. you’ve been warned!


stick around if you want to watch a german teenager try to survive canadian winters and probably embarrass herself in the process 🍁


xoxo ✨
