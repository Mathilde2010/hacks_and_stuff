		hey hey! 
		
<p>welcome to my chaotic little corner of the internet lol
	so basically i’m your typical 15-year-old german girl who’s about to turn 16 (finally!! been waiting forever) and honestly i have no idea what i’m doing with my life but here we are 💀</p>

<p>i’m literally obsessed with romance books like it’s actually concerning… my bookshelf is 90% enemies-to-lovers and i regret NOTHING. if you catch me crying over fictional men at 2am, no you didn’t ✋</p>

<p>when i’m not busy being delulu about book boyfriends, you can find me playing flute (yes i am that girl in orchestra, we exist), dancing around my room like nobody’s watching (spoiler: my neighbors probably are and i’m sorry), or hanging out with my friends 24/7 because we’re basically attached at the hip</p>

<p>OH and plot twist - in a few months i’m yeeting myself to canada for a whole year abroad!! kinda terrified but also SO excited?? like imagine all the maple syrup and apologizing i’ll get to do 😭</p>

<p>this blog is gonna be my way of documenting all the chaos, the feels, the random 3am thoughts, and probably way too many photos of my coffee. you’ve been warned!</p>

<p>stick around if you want to watch a german teenager try to survive canadian winters and probably embarrass herself in the process 🍁</p>

xoxo ✨
